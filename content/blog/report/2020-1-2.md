## [System Design: Tinder as a microservice architecture, Gaurav Sen, 2018.7.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tndzLznxq40)

Tinder Architecture

1. Store Profiles (Images) - 5 images per user
2. Recommend matches (Active 유저의 수)
3. note matches
4. Direct Messaging

Image를 저장할 때의 관건은 File vs Blob(DB)

### features you get when you use DB(Storing Images as Blob)

1. Mutability - not really need Mutability. why not just save separate file
2. Transaction guarantees - there's no need to do some atomic operation on images
3. indexes(Improve Search) - because we don't need to search data on Blob (it's just 0s and 1s), it's not also needed
4. Access Control

### good things when you use File System

1. Cheaper
2. Faster
3. Content Delivery network

### How to implement Updating Profiles

on traditional Monolitic system, you can have user account and password(or token) on request and update profile and send success response. that's enough for now. but what if we have another feature on tomorrow and need authentication for that feature too.

good way is to have a Gateway Service and so decouple system and no need to duplicate authentication logic.

### How to send Direct Messages

#### Protocol

on Client-Server communication protocol, HTTP? it is inefficient. peer-peer protocol would be better. XMPP is what you want to use.

on Websocket or TCP

#### Who's gonna maintain these connections

It can be served by Gateway Service. but decouple as much as possible. so make Sessions Service.

### Noting Recommendation

Profile Service could handle it or Matcher service would handle it.

### How to Recommend Matching

there are ages, locations, etc on profile DB. which DB would be good.

1. Cassandra/Dynamo
2. sharding -> horizontal partitioning (spliting data by location or ages, and searching)
