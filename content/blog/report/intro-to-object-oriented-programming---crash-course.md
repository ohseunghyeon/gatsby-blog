## 4 principles of OOP

- encapsulation

access or manipulation to the attribute should be done by method

- abstraction

Abstraction allows the program to be worked on incrementally and prevents it from becoming entangled and complex

Determine specific points of contact that can act as an interface between classes, and only worry about the implementation when coding it

- Inheritance

class hierarchy

access modifiers

public, private, protected

- polymorphism

dynamic polymorphism occurs during the runtime of the program

static polymorphism occurs during compile-time - overloading (methods of the same name but different number of parameters, different types of parameters, different order of parameters)
